# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

Another blockchain example project!

Based on buildspace tutorials!

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. Split on two folders, blockchain: It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. And client that interacts with the contract.

Deployed on: https://rassell.github.io/wave-portal/ to use it with Rinkeby testnet.
